Instruction focuses on communication, infection control, safety, residentsâ€™ rights, and basic nursing skills.

Students should complete Principles of Health Science and Emergency Procedures prior to taking this course. This program meets the requirements set forth by Kentucky Medicaid program and provides the opportunity for students to become Nurse Aid State Registered. </p>
